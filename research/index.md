**Overview**
Our research focuses on fundamental questions in ecology, island biology, biogeography, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology. We primarily use genomic data, such as reference genomes and population/species-level sampling, which we integrate with environmental and phenotypic data.

**Research Questions**
Our work explores key themes such as speciation, adaptation, molecular evolution, and island biology. Some of the questions we investigate include: How do genomes evolve? How do species adapt to new ecological niches? How does adaptation to these niches influence genome evolution? What drives diversifications and/or adaptive radiations? What is the biogeography of specific lineages?

**Study Systems**
We mainly focus on insular systems. Currently, our lab is researching the Galápagos *Scalesia* radiation, Galápagos *Darwiniothamnus* and *Lecocarpus*, the Cabo Verdean endemic sparrow (*Passer iagoensis*), and various lineages from the Malay Archipelago.

**Publications**
While we do not keep a curated collection of publications exclusive to the laboratory, you can check out the [scholar profile of the group coordinator, José Cerca](https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=ZI1vWPEAAAAJ&hl=en)
